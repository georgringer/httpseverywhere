This TYPO3 extension, adds a PSR-15 middleware to upgrade any request from
non-https to a http request. In times of "https everywhere" in the internet
and local development environments with e.g. mkcert (which works o-o-t-b in
DDEV) you don't have to work without a valid certificate for your TLS connection
with your TYPO3 instance.
